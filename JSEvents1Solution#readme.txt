DOM - Events - Example 1 Solution
In the example we write a handler to display the current time in response to a user clicking a button on a web page.

When "Run", the page initially contains a button with the text Click to see the current time. There is also a paragraph with the text PLACEHOLDER directly beneath the button.

Task Completed:
Instead of using timeBtn.addEventListener("click", dispTime);to add a listener - edited to all of the following (and ran the code):

bdlclick
mousedown
mouseover
What happens if you have more than one listener on the same event handler?
